# Cadet

Cadet is a tool I've been constantly adjusting to adapt to the Concourse team's day to day workflows. It's written as a general tool - it doesn't know anything about Concourse - but the practices it supports are entirely up to the needs of the Concourse team, so feel free to play with it but don't expect anything to be stable!
